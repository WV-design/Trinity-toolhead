# __Trinity-toolhead__

I took inspiration from Takeoff, Calamity, Tiger's toolhead, IROB and fiberstream, and came up with this: 
A small footprint unibody high performance toolhead option.

## This is currently untested, I am still working on it. I would love your feedback! Discord: gerbz_

* The body is a single print to maximize weight, strength and stiffness.
* The hotend is supported at the bottom of the heatsink to increase stiffness.
* Double 3628 fans deliver enough cooling even for hot chambers.
* Made to duel! the Y footprint is smaller than the sherpa mini.
* Relatively ight weight, estimated ~400g.
* Good COM

## Recommended parts:
* 1x Fystec sherpa mini v3
* ~~bad~~ dragon ace volcano
* 2x Delta 3628
* 1x Delta 2510
### GT2 belts only, gt3 is thicker and needs more tension. I am not confident in the plastic holding up to that.

## Compatibility:

Note: The Y footprint of this toolhead is VERY small so you likely get extra travel. This means the Y travel, and thus the printer as a whole can be smaller.



### Voron
Partial compatibility with voron trident and 2 gantries 
* Gantry must be flipped so there is more space under the xy joints
* Cablechains for X cant be used

### Monolith
currently only mgn12 is supported
| variant | compatibility status |
|---------------|------------------|
| printed 6mm belts | fully compatible |
| sheet metal 6mm belts | fully compatible |
| printed 9mm belts | fully compatible |
| sheet metal 9mm belts | fully compatible |
| > 9mm belts | not supported |
