### Heads up, read this page before printing!
Trinity is too tall for most belt tensioners, therefore Prooda developed a new one. This can be found in the "extras" section

### selection single/multi color
I designed a "logo cutout" piece so you can choose how to print the logo. Options include:
- multi color. the file includes inset edges on the front face, so the slicer should be able to easily fill the faces with colors. [You can do this on a normal single toolhead printer without an mmu if you change the filament by hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m_Wf59O1xk)

- single color with inset logo, for this option you need to do some slicer tricks. You can use the "logo cutout" as a negative body to cut into the main body. It's explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e7CY2rMzgA)

- single color without logo, this is the easiest, you simply delete the logo cutout before printing.
