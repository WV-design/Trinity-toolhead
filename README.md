# __Trinity-toolhead__

I took inspiration from Takeoff, Calamity, Tiger's toolhead, IROB and fiberstream, and came up with this: 
A small footprint unibody high performance toolhead option.

## This is currently untested, I am still working on it. I would love your feedback!

* The body is a single print to maximize weight, strength and stiffness.
* The hotend is supported at the bottom of the heatsink to increase stiffness.
* Double 3628 fans deliver enough cooling even for hot chambers.
* Optimised for dual gantry printers, the Y footprint of the toolhead itself is smaller than the sherpa mini.
* Light weight, estimated ~370g.
* The COM is on point!

## Recommended parts:
* 1x Fystec sherpa mini v3
* ~~bad~~ dragon ace volcano
* 2x Delta 3628
* 1x Delta 2510

## Compatibility:

Note: The Y footprint of this toolhead is VERY small so you likely get extra travel. This means the Y travel, and thus the printer as a whole can be smaller.

### Voron
Partial compatibility with voron trident and 2 gantries 
* Gantry must be flipped so there is more space under the xy joints
* Cablechains for X cant be used

### Monolith

| variant | compatibility status |

## Current TODO list:
* ✓ Belt clamps
* ✓ Mgn12 compatibility
* ✓ Ducts
* Wider extruder compatibility
