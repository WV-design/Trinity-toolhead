## It should be obvious in what orientation to print this.

### Settings:
* Layer height, 0.12-0.2mm
* wall count ~6-100(only walls).
* top/bottom layers => 5

 There needs to be a pause in the print to insert 2 of the hotend bolts. This should be at ~10.6mm. At this point 2 m2.5x8mm bolts should be inserted.
