Hi! If you're here you probably want to learn more about the design and how/why it was made. I want to talk about those nerdy details here.
If you have questions, feel free to reach out to me via discord!

### Form factor
This whole design started from wanting a toolhead with a super minimal Y footprint. I am working on a dual gantry printer where toolhead Y losses are doubled. I didnt really love anything that I could find so I decided on a little scope creep as a treat. 


2 of these toolheads next to eachother take up less Y space than a stealthburner (with cable chain), Of course there still need to be XY joints but those can be made small enough.
