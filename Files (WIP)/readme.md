## Heads up
Trinity is too tall for most belt tensioners, therefore Prooda developed a new one. This can be found in the "extras" section

### Print settings:
* Layer height: anything between 0.04-0.2mm should be fine. Consider a smaller (~0.12mm) layer height for the ducts
* Wall count: ~6-solid(only walls).
* Top/bottom layers: => 5
* Infill: doesn't really matter because of the walls and top layers but ~25% helps with internal overhangs.
* Print it slowly, strength and layer adhesion are important for the toolhead's performance. The easiest way to do this is to limit the flowrate in the slicer.


### material choice:
Fiber filled filaments are preferred because of the increase in stiffness 
* < 70C ABS 
* < 100C PC-PBT
* PC (look for a Tg of ~130C or higher, the rest is blended/impure)
* PET (annealed)
* PPS (annealed) (also what chamber temp are you planning to go for?? poor fans...)
