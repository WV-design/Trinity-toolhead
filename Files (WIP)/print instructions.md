### It should be obvious in what orientation to print this.

## Settings:
* Layer height: anything between 0.04-0.2mm should be fine
* Wall count: ~6-solid(only walls).
* Top/bottom layers: => 5
* Infill: shouldnt really matter because of the walls and top layers but ~40% helps with internal overhangs.
* 0.4 and 0.5mm nozzles are supported
* Counterbore holes partially bridged is recommended

## VERY IMPORTANT!
There needs to be a pause in the print at ~10.6mm. At this point 2 m2.5x8mm bolts for the hotend should be inserted. This needs to happen before the bridge closing off these parts

## materials:
Fiber filled filaments are preferred because of the increase in stiffness 
* < 70C ABS 
* < 100C PC-PBT
* PC (look for a Tg of ~130C or higher, the rest is blended/impure)
* PET (annealed)
* PPS (annealed) (also what chamber temp are you planning to go for?? poor fans...)
