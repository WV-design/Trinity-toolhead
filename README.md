# __Trinity-toolhead__
A small footprint monolithic high performance toolhead option.
![Untitled Project (11)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/230cbced-bb03-4351-957d-a6a59152c4f1)

I took inspiration from Takeoff, Calamity, Tiger's toolhead and IROB, and came up with this. It will be monolith compatible.

## This is currently untested, I am still working on it. I would love your feedback!

* The body is a single print for maximum stiffness.
* The hotend is supported at the bottom of the heatsink to increase stiffness
* Couble 3628 fans deliver enough cooling for hot chambers
* Optimised for dual gantry printers, the toolhead itself has a smaller Y footprint than the sherpa mini.
* Light weight, estimated ~360g
* The COM is absolutely on point!

## Current TODO list:
* Belt clamps
* Monolith compatibility
* MGN12 (not needed because of the COM but why not :) )
*
